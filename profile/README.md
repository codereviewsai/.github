## At Joggr, we give a 🦆 about docs.

Docs start fresh and useful, but give them a sprint or two and they’re outdated, misplaced, or flat-out wrong. They live in wikis no one checks, fall out of sync with the code, and end up like an unmerged PR—forgotten and full of conflicts.  

The core problem? Docs platforms aren’t designed with us (devs) in mind.  

### Joggr fixes that.  
It’s an internal docs platform built for devs who’d rather ship features than format wikis.  

#### With Joggr, you get:  
⚡ **CLI-first** – Write docs like you write code.  
🔄 **Auto-updating** – No more stale docs.  
🛠 **IDE-integrated** – Docs where you work, not buried in a wiki.  
📂 **All-in-one** – READMEs, collaborative docs, and diagrams in one platform.

<h2>
  ⚡ Who are We
</h2>

When Zac & Seth (who are brothers) sat down in 2023 and discussed their biggest pain points at work, they discovered that the root of most of the issues they faced, was that their teams didn't have the knowledge & documentation they needed to do their jobs, which lead to teams constantly distracting one another to get help.

Our mission is to create the best internal docs experience for developers. Just as great public documentation supports users, we believe internal docs should have the same level of quality and attention.

* ⏫ [tempo](https://github.com/joggrdocs/tempo) - Programmatically create Markdown documents.
* 🏃 [marathon](https://github.com/joggrdocs/marathon) - Standard documentation templates, with a programmatic interface.
